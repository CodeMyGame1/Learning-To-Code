An introduction to GitReddyHub:

Hey guys! Welcome to GitReddyHub! Here's a basic description about me. My name is Pranesh, and I am 11 years old. I like to code, draw, color, and play video games. I have a YouTube channel, called, "CodeMyGame", where I have some epic content! Also, I have an amazing friend called Ariz, who is also 11, and is the owner of a channel called, "Ariz Animates". Check him out, he's a pretty funny guy actually! So, have fun, and yeah!
